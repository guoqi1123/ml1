# Quizzes
There will be six quizzes, and the worst one will be dropped. Each quiz is 60 minutes long. Each quiz will carry 8%. The quizzes are conducted right after the due date of the homework. You will be given a 48-hour window to complete the 60-min quiz, completely online. During the quiz, I will ask you lecture questions. I will also ask you homework questions. For example, if in the homework I ask you to plot a figure, I may ask you to change a parameter and re-plot the figure. Quizzes will be open-book, open-note, open-computer. However, with only 60 minutes, you probably will not have time to read anything besides answering the questions. So, please do the homework. On the contrary, if you attend the lecture and do your homework, you will find 60 mins to be much more than enough for the quiz.
