# ECE 50024 / STAT 59800: LaTeX

## Why use LaTeX?  
We encourage you to typeset your homework solutions in LaTeX. Typing your solution in LaTeX has multiple advantages:

- It is easier for us to grade.
- You will have a clean and typed solution for record.
- Some equations can be used in later homeworks so you do not need to retype.
- Majority of the journals and conferences in machine learning only accept LaTeX manuscripts. If you like to do research in machine learning, you should learn LaTeX as soon as possible.

## Getting started with LaTeX
To help you get started with LaTeX, we suggest the following online resources.
- [Overleaf (Website)](https://www.overleaf.com/)  
    I highly recommend overleaf, if you are a beginner of LaTeX. Overleaf is an online LaTeX platform. It can save you an enormous amount of time installing LaTeX on your local machine. As a Purdue student, you can use overleaf for free with quite a lot of storage space.

- [LaTeX Tutorial (Website)](https://www.latex-tutorial.com/)  
    This is a tutorial website that contains most of the basic tools you need for LaTeX.

## Install LaTeX on local machines
If you like to install LaTeX on your local machine, there are a lot of resources online you can get help from.

- [MikTeX Installation (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDRuD03vkzI)
- [MikTeX on Windows and Ubuntu (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6ez7sbaiWc)
- [MacTeX on Mac (Youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvGQ2Mrhf7g)
